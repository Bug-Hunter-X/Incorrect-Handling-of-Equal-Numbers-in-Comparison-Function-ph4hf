# Python Bug: Incorrect Handling of Equal Numbers

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python code: Incorrect handling of equal numbers in a comparison function. The function `my_function` aims to return the larger of two numbers, but it contains a subtle bug where it does not correctly handle the case when both numbers are equal, always returning the first number instead of either.
